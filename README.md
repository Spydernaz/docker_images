# Spyder's Docker Images #

## Introduction ##

This is a collection of images built and maintainer by Nathaniel Vala (@Spydernaz, a.k.a. Nate)
These images are used for quick PoC's and testing apps in development and not meant for production use as is. Please feel free to use / learn from this repo and [Nate's Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm4X6i6qJ8nIjVB1Dg5GEog) (Coming soon)

I use Linux / Mac and do not have an Windows Enterprise or Pro license and therefore am unable to test the images for Windows. If you are able to text and fix images for Windows I would love to have a windows based branch!

## Images ##

Each image should have it's own documentation in the file directory of the image. I try my best to keep these images updated however if there is something missing or not working feel free to raise an issue and I will try to help you out when I can.

| Image Name | Version | Status |
|:---------- |:-------:|:------:|
| Apache Ranger | master | Passing |
| Apache Ranger | experimental | Passing |
| Apache Atlas | master | Failing |
| Apache Atlas | experimental | Passing |
| Kerberos Base | master | Passing |

## Compose Files ##

There are also a number of docker-compose files here. These are for my testing unless specified otherwise and may contain local ImageIDs and therefore not work on your machine.

## Raising Issues ##

I am completely open to issues being raised and I will get to them as soon as I am able to however it is important to give me as much information as possible to help identify and resolve the problem. 

## Conclusion ##

Have fun and enjoy the images

:)
